% % log(n) Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of n.
% % semilogy(x,y) Graphs a plot of y vs. x using a logarithmic scale (powers of ten) on
% % the y-axis.
% % semilogx(x,y) Graphs a plot of y vs. x using a logarithmic scale (powers of ten) on
% % the x-axis.
% % loglog(x,y) Graphs a plot of y vs. x using a logarithmic scale (powers of ten) on
% % both axes. The logarithmic scales prove most useful when the value
% % spans multiple orders of magnitude

% Graph the efficiency of several programming algorithms according to big-O notation, a method
% of describing the running time of algorithms. Each expression represents the scale by which an
% algorithm’s computation time increases as the number of its input elements increases. For example,
% O(n) represents an algorithm that scales linearly, so that its computation time increases at the
% same rate as the number of elements. The algorithms you must graph have the following big-O
% characteristics:
% Algorithm #1: O(n)
% Algorithm #2: O(n2)
% Algorithm #3: O(n3)
% Algorithm #4: O(2n)
% Algorithm #5: O(en)
% After generating an initial graph with ranging from 0 to 8, use logarithmic scaling on the y-axis
% of a second graph to make it more readable. You can also use the mouse to change the y-axis
% scale. Go to the main menu of the figure, click Edit>Axes Properties. . . , the property editor dialogue
% will pop out. There, you can also change the font, the range of the axes, . . . Try to play with it.
